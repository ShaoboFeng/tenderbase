TenderBase is a fork of perst, an object-oriented database for Java and .NET (C#).

Perst used to have a liberal BSD license up to version 2.49.

In version 2.50 Perst changed the licensing to dual-license scheme:
 * free GPLv2 code
 * commerical license available for fee

This is a fork or Perst 2.49, so it retains the liberal BSD license.

The goal of this project is to:
 * port the code to C#
 * maintain and improve it
